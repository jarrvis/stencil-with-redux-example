# Stencil with Redux example

This is a simple demo using Stencil with the [Stencil Redux](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-redux) collection.

Stencil Redux is a small library that uses the vanilla Redux library and automatically supplies state to props on components, as well as binding actions to the store's dispatch.

This example is a fork of https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-redux-demo. It should serve as a practical example of using Stencil Reducx. Additionaly it shows how to resolve component lifecycle order issue: https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/1261
